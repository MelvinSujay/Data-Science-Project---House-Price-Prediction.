# Data-Science-Project---House-Price-Prediction.
This project revolves around the development of a comprehensive solution for predicting house prices in Bangalore, India. The primary goal is to create an intuitive web application that provides users with a user-friendly interface to estimate property values based on various factors.
The project encompasses a wide range of technologies to achieve this goal, including JavaScript for interactive web functionalities, HTML for structured content presentation, and CSS for elegant and responsive styling. The integration of these technologies allows users to easily access and interact with the application while offering a seamless and visually appealing experience.
Moreover, this project is underpinned by a robust foundation of data collection and machine learning. In the Jupyter Notebook environment, real-world information from Kaggle and the web is meticulously gathered and used for machine learning model training. This data exploration and preparation phase involves retrieving real and up-to-date data about house prices in Bangalore, enabling the model to provide accurate predictions.
HTML (index.html):
The HTML component forms the foundation of our web application. It provides a structured layout for user interaction. Users can input essential property details such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and bathrooms. The HTML structure ensures clarity and ease of use for the end user.
CSS (styles.css):
The CSS component defines the visual styling of our web application. It sets the stage for an attractive and responsive design. Elements are carefully styled to create an appealing user interface. Additionally, responsive design techniques are implemented to optimize the application's display on various devices and screen sizes.
JavaScript (script.js):
JavaScript brings interactivity and functionality to our web application. The script.js file contains the logic for handling user input, performing house price predictions, and updating the user interface with estimated property prices. The integration of JavaScript enables real-time feedback and enhances the overall user experience.
Jupyter Notebook (bangalore_house_price_prediction.ipynb):
The Jupyter Notebook plays a pivotal role in this project. It serves as the data science hub, where we explore, preprocess, and model real estate data. We conduct data cleaning, outlier detection, and machine learning model training within the notebook. The trained model is then serialized for integration with the web interface.
This project's key highlights and components in jupyter notebook (python): 
- Data Preparation: Real estate data from Bangalore undergoes thorough exploration and preprocessing. This involves feature selection, handling missing data, and engineering meaningful attributes.
- Outlier Detection: An anomaly detection mechanism is applied to identify outliers in property prices, enhancing prediction accuracy.
- Data Visualization: Visualizations such as scatter plots and histograms provide insights into property price distributions and trends.
- Machine Learning: A Linear Regression model is trained on preprocessed data, enabling accurate house price predictions.
- Hyperparameter Tuning:  GridSearchCV optimizes model parameters for robust predictions.
- User-Friendly Interface: The model is integrated into a user-friendly web app. Users input property details to receive estimated prices.
- Location Analysis: A feature analyzes location-based price trends, aiding users in exploring and comparing property values.
- Persistence: The trained model is saved for future use, and column information is stored in JSON format for easy reference.

In summary, this project combines data science and web development to create a valuable tool for individuals seeking to estimate house prices in Bangalore. The integration of machine learning and user-friendly web design ensures that users can access accurate predictions effortlessly, enhancing the real estate decision-making process.
